       " {'question': 'Tell me the description for Kingston IronKey Keypad 200 Series FIPS 140-3 Level 3 (Pending) with XTS-AES 256-bit Hardware Encryption',\n",
       "  'answer': 'The Kingston IronKey™ Keypad 200 series are OS-independent, hardware-encrypted USB Type-A and USB Type-C1 drives with an alphanumeric keypad for easy-to-use PIN access. The KP200 incorporates XTS-AES 256-bit hardware-based encryption. It also is FIPS 140-3 Level 3 (Pending) certified for military-grade security with enhancements that further raise the bar for data protection. Its circuitry is covered by a layer of special epoxy that makes it virtually impossible to remove components without damaging them; this tough epoxy stops attacks against the semiconductor components. The drive is designed to be tamper evident to alert owners. It also incorporates brute force password attack protection, and BadUSB protection with digitally signed firmware. The alphanumeric keypad is coated with a layer of polymer that protects the keys and hides key usage through analysis of fingerprints on the keys. KP200 series utilises a built-in rechargeable battery that can be used to unlock the drive first without using any software, and then plug it into any device that supports USB Type-A or USB Type-C mass storage devices. This gives users the most flexibility across different platform types and operating systems. With the Multi-PIN option (Admin/User), the keypad can be used to set up an easy-to-remember but hard-to guess alphanumeric PIN for the Admin or User accounts. Admin can restore a User PIN and provide access to the drive should the User PIN be forgotten, or if the drive is locked after reaching the maximum of 10 User login attempts. With both Admin and User PINs enabled, KP200 will lock the User PIN after 10 failed login attempts; if the Admin PIN is entered incorrectly 10 times in a row, brute force attack protection will crypto-erase the drive, destroy the data forever, and reset it.The drive also provides two levels of Read-Only (or Write-Protect) modes – a Global mode that can be set by Admin, and a session-only mode that can be set by User. Read-Only modes can protect the drive from malware on untrusted systems. In addition, Admin can load content and set Global Read-Only mode, so that User can access the data but not make any changes.'},\n",

LP50 is also TAA compliant.LP50 now supports multi-password (Admin and User) option with Complex or Passphrase modes. Complex mode allows for passwords from 6-16 characters using 3 out of 4 character sets. New passphrase mode allows for a numeric PIN, sentence, list of words or even lyrics from 10 to 64 characters long. Admin can enable a User password, or reset the User password to restore access to data. To aid in password entry, the “eye” symbol can be enabled to reveal the typed in password, reducing typos leading to failed login attempts. Brute Force attack protection locks out User upon 10 invalid password entries in a row and crypto-erases the drive if the Admin password is entered incorrectly 10 times in a row. Additionally, a built-in virtual keyboard shields passwords from keyloggers or screenloggers. Locker+ 50 is designed for convenience with a small metal casing and built-in key loop to take data anywhere. LP50 also features optional USBtoCloud (by ClevX) backup to access data on the drive from your personal cloud storage through Google Drive™, OneDrive (Microsoft), Amazon Cloud Drive, Dropbox™ or Box.

VP50 has been penetration tested2 (pen tested) for enterprise-grade security. Because it provides encrypted storage under the user’s physical control, the VP50 series is superior to using the internet and cloud services to safeguard data. Vault Privacy 50 supports multi-password options (Admin, User and One-Time Recovery) with Complex or Passphrase modes. This enhances the ability to recover access to the data if one of the passwords is forgotten. Traditional Complex mode allows for passwords from 6-16 characters using 3 out of 4 character sets. The new Passphrase mode allows for a numeric PIN, sentence, list of words or even lyrics from 10 to 64 characters long. Admin can enable a User and a One-Time Recovery password, or reset the User password to restore data access. To aid in password entry, the “eye” symbol can be enabled to reveal the typed-in password, reducing typos that lead to failed login attempts. Brute force attack protection locks out User or One-Time Recovery passwords if 10 invalid passwords are entered in a row, and crypto-erases the drive if the Admin password is entered incorrectly 10 times in a row.To protect against potential malware on untrusted systems, both Admin and User can set Read-Only mode to write-protect the drive; additionally, the built-in virtual keyboard shields passwords from keyloggers or screenloggers.Organisations can customise and configure VP50 series drives with a product ID (PID) for integration with standard endpoint management software to meet corporate IT and cybersecurity requirement through Kingston’s Customisation Programme.Small and medium businesses can use the Admin role to locally manage their drives, e.g. use Admin to configure or reset employee User or One-Time Recovery passwords, recover data access on locked drives and comply with laws and regulations when forensics are required.Vault Privacy 50 is waterproof with IPX8 rating3, TAA compliant and assembled in the USA.'},\n",
